# CloneAndGo

A 30-line HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate. No npm, no build—just clone and add what you need. Hackathons, prototypes, quick starts—zero faff.

## Why?
Setup sucks. Not every project needs React or a build process—sometimes `index.html`, CSS, and JS are all you need. CloneAndGo’s that blank slate: add Tailwind, fonts, whatever you want, or just keep it raw.

## What’s Inside?
- `index.html`: HTML5, viewport, linked CSS/JS.
- `styles.css`: Tiny reset—`box-sizing`, zero margins, sans-serif.
- `script.js`: Logs “Ready!”—blank for your JS.

## How to Use
1. `git clone https://github.com/mukeshkumar108/cloneandgo.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Add what you want—save, refresh, done.

No Node, no fluff. Naturally responsive—viewport’s in.

## Who’s This For?
Designers, devs, hackers, anyone who wants basics and freedom.

## License
MIT—add whatever, it’s yours.
